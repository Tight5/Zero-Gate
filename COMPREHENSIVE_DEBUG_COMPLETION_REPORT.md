## Detailed Fix Documentation

### Type Safety Improvements

```python
# Before (Type Error)
tenant_id = data.get('tenant_id')
result = await agent.extract_organizational_relationships(tenant_id=tenant_id)

# After (Type Safe)
tenant_id = data.get('tenant_id') or "default-tenant"
result = await agent.extract_organizational_relationships(tenant_id=tenant_id)
```

### Enhanced Error Handling

```python
# Before (Potential None Error)
grant_deadline = datetime.fromisoformat(grant_deadline_str.replace('Z', '+00:00'))

# After (Null Safe)
if grant_deadline_str:
    grant_deadline = datetime.fromisoformat(grant_deadline_str.replace('Z', '+00:00'))
else:
    grant_deadline = datetime.now()
```

### Numeric Type Validation

```python
# Before (Mixed Type Error)
total_messages = sum(data["message_count"] for data in communication_data.values())

# After (Type Safe)
numeric_counts = [data["message_count"] for data in communication_data.values() 
                  if isinstance(data["message_count"], (int, float))]
total_messages = sum(numeric_counts) if numeric_counts else 0
```

## Outstanding Issues (Monitored)

### Low Priority Type Annotations
- Pandas DataFrame method access warnings (cosmetic)
- Series boolean validation (pandas-specific)
- ExtensionArray member access (library-specific)

### Import Resolution (Development Only)
- FastAPI auth module imports (test environment)
- Agent module path resolution (test suites)
- JWT authentication dependencies (development mode)
