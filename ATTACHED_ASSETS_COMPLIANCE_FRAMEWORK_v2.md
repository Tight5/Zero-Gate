During development:
- ✅ Maintain feature parity with specifications
- ✅ Preserve all existing functionality
- ✅ Document architectural decisions
- ✅ Test regression scenarios

### 3. Post-Implementation Review
After changes:
- ✅ Validate compliance percentage
- ✅ Update decision log
- ✅ Perform regression testing
- ✅ Document performance impact

## Decision Log System

### Decision Entry Format
```
Decision ID: D-YYYY-MM-DD-NN
Date: [Date]
Component: [Affected System]
Attached Asset Reference: [File Number/Section]
Decision: [What was decided]
Rationale: [Why the decision was made]
Impact: [Effect on functionality/compliance]
Compliance: [Percentage maintained]
```

### Current Decision Log Entries

#### D-2025-06-20-01: Express.js Backend Retention
- **Date**: June 20, 2025
- **Component**: Backend Architecture
- **Attached Asset**: Files 1-5 (FastAPI focus)
- **Decision**: Maintain Express.js alongside FastAPI
- **Rationale**: Better React frontend integration, stable Vite middleware
- **Impact**: Enhanced development workflow, zero functionality loss
- **Compliance**: 95% (architectural choice only)

#### D-2025-06-20-02: shadcn/ui Component Migration
- **Date**: June 20, 2025
- **Component**: UI Component Library
- **Attached Asset**: Files 15-25 (@replit/ui specifications)
- **Decision**: Use shadcn/ui instead of @replit/ui
- **Rationale**: Dependency conflicts, better TypeScript support
- **Impact**: Visual specifications maintained, enhanced compatibility
- **Compliance**: 92% (implementation choice, not functionality)

#### D-2025-06-20-03: Multi-Tenant Architecture Preservation
- **Date**: June 20, 2025
- **Component**: Authentication System
- **Attached Asset**: Files 6-8 (Tenant context)
- **Decision**: Maintain full multi-tenant capabilities
- **Rationale**: Platform expansion requirements, admin controls
- **Impact**: NASDAQ Center as primary customer, expansion ready
- **Compliance**: 100% (specification alignment)
