## Test Execution Instructions

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_tenant_isolation.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_grant_timeline.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_path_discovery.py -v
```

### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
python scripts/run-comprehensive-tests.py
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
pytest --junitxml=test-results.xml tests/
```

## Expected Test Results

### Success Criteria
- All tenant isolation tests pass (100% data segregation)
- Grant timeline generation creates appropriate 90/60/30-day milestones
- Path discovery finds optimal connection paths within seven degrees
