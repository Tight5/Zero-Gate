**Report Type**: Build alignment completion summary  
**Status**: Critical fixes implemented, TypeScript errors resolved

---

## Executive Summary

Following comprehensive critical analysis against all 46 attached asset specifications, I have implemented targeted fixes to resolve divergences and improve build alignment. The platform now demonstrates enhanced compliance with original specifications while maintaining operational stability.

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Badge Component Compatibility Issues ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: PathDiscovery component using non-existent `size` prop on Badge components
**Solution**: Removed invalid `size` props from all Badge components
**Files Fixed**:
- `client/src/components/features/PathDiscovery.tsx` (4 instances)
- `client/src/components/features/HybridRelationshipMapping.tsx` (maintained proper typing)

**Impact**: Eliminated TypeScript compilation errors, improved component reliability

### 2. Type Safety Enhancement ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Multiple TypeScript type casting and implicit any type issues
**Solution**: Added explicit type annotations and proper parameter typing
**Files Fixed**:
- `client/src/components/features/HybridRelationshipMapping.tsx`
  - Added proper typing for filter functions
  - Fixed force simulation type annotations
  - Enhanced path rendering with explicit types
- `client/src/components/features/ExcelFileProcessor.tsx`
  - Fixed query status access pattern with proper type casting

**Impact**: Improved code maintainability and eliminated implicit any warnings

### 3. Authentication Context Enhancement ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: User type definition missing tenant-related properties
**Solution**: Extended User interface to include tenant information
**Files Fixed**:
- `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added tenants property to User interface
- `client/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Enhanced tenant indicator display
- `shared/schema.ts` - Improved user schema with proper constraints

**Impact**: Better alignment with multi-tenant architecture specifications

### 4. Hook Integration Stabilization ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: TenantContext dependency causing integration issues
**Solution**: Implemented fallback patterns for development mode
**Files Fixed**:
- `client/src/hooks/useTenantData.ts` - Added development tenant fallback
- `client/src/hooks/useRelationshipData.ts` - Maintained compatibility

**Impact**: Stable hook functionality during development and debugging

## Specification Alignment Improvements

### Component Compliance Status After Fixes:
