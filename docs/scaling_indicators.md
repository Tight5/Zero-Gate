- **Bug Fix Time**: >1 week for non-critical issues
- **Code Review Bottlenecks**: >5 PRs waiting for review
- **Testing Coverage**: <80% test coverage

## Scaling Decision Matrix

### Immediate Scaling Required (Red Zone)
Multiple indicators from:
- CPU/Memory >90% for >30 minutes
- API response times >5 seconds
- Database queries failing
- User complaints about performance
- Revenue loss due to performance

### Scaling Recommended (Yellow Zone)
Several indicators from:
- Resource utilization >80%
- Response times >2 seconds
- Feature availability <75%
- User growth >10%/month
- Support tickets increasing

### Optimization Sufficient (Green Zone)
Most indicators below thresholds:
- Resource utilization <70%
- Response times <1 second
- All features available >95% time
- Stable user growth
- Low support ticket volume

## Replit-Specific Considerations

### Platform Limitations
- **Maximum RAM**: Cannot exceed Replit plan limits
- **CPU Cores**: Limited by plan tier
- **Network I/O**: Potential throttling on high usage
- **Storage**: File system performance limitations
- **Database Connections**: SQLite connection limits

### Optimization Strategies Before Scaling
1. **Code Optimization**: Profile and optimize hot paths
2. **Caching**: Implement Redis for relationship data
3. **Database Optimization**: Add indexes, query optimization
4. **Feature Flags**: Disable non-critical features during peak
5. **Lazy Loading**: Implement for large datasets

## Cloud Migration Triggers

### Technical Triggers
- Any single metric consistently in red zone
- Multiple yellow zone metrics simultaneously
- Replit plan upgrade insufficient
- Customer enterprise requirements
- Compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR)

### Business Triggers
- Revenue >$10K MRR
- Enterprise customer acquisition
- Investor requirements
- Competitive pressures
- International expansion needs

## Monitoring Setup

### Automated Alerts
```javascript
// Example alert configuration
const alerts = {
  cpu_usage: { threshold: 80, duration: '15m' },
  memory_usage: { threshold: 85, duration: '10m' },
  api_response_time: { threshold: 2000, percentile: 95 },
  error_rate: { threshold: 5, duration: '5m' }
};
```

### Dashboard Metrics
- Real-time resource utilization
- API performance trends
- User growth trends
- Feature availability status
- Revenue/usage correlation
