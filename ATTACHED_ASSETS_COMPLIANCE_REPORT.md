# Attached Assets Compliance Report
**Generated**: June 20, 2025  
**Purpose**: Systematic cross-reference of all platform implementations against attached_assets specifications  
**Status**: Resource Assessment and Memory Optimization Corrected

## Executive Summary

Successfully corrected critical memory optimization misinterpretation and restored platform to proper resource-aware operation utilizing actual 62GB system capacity. All implementations now cross-referenced against attached assets with comprehensive compliance tracking.

### Critical Correction Completed
- **Memory Crisis Resolution**: Identified overly aggressive optimization that misinterpreted browser heap limits (2-3GB) as system memory crisis
- **Resource Reality Check**: Confirmed 62GB total system memory with 14GB available - no actual crisis exists
- **Performance Restoration**: Restored cache sizes (100 queries), refresh intervals (5 minutes), and feature availability
- **Intelligent Management**: Implemented progressive browser heap monitoring (85% normal, 90% optimization, 95% emergency)
