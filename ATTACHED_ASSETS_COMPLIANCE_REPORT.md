## Resource Assessment Analysis

### Critical Memory Management Correction

#### Problem Identified
The platform was operating under overly aggressive memory optimization protocols based on misinterpretation of browser heap limits as system memory constraints.

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Confusion:** Browser heap limits (1-4GB typical) interpreted as total system memory
- **Reality:** 62GB total system memory with 14GB available - no actual crisis
- **Impact:** Artificial performance degradation and feature restrictions

#### Correction Implementation
1. **System Memory Recognition:** Properly distinguished 62GB system capacity from browser heap
2. **Threshold Adjustment:** Updated to browser heap thresholds (85%/90%/95%)
3. **Performance Restoration:** Removed artificial cache and interval restrictions
4. **Resource Utilization:** Leveraging full system capacity for enhanced performance

#### Performance Improvements
- **Cache Size:** Restored from emergency 10-50 queries to optimal 100 queries
- **Stale Time:** Improved from 1-2 minutes to balanced 5 minutes
- **Cache Time:** Enhanced from 2 minutes to standard 10 minutes
- **Refresh Intervals:** Optimized for performance vs emergency degradation
