## Implementation Details

### Tenant Isolation Test Coverage
- Cross-tenant data boundary validation
- Authentication token verification across tenant contexts
- Role permission testing (admin vs user access)
- Invalid UUID and missing tenant header handling
- Concurrent request processing with tenant switching
- Data cleanup verification ensuring no cross-contamination

### Grant Timeline Test Coverage
- Automatic milestone generation from submission deadlines
- Backwards planning algorithm validation (90/60/30-day intervals)
- Task assignment appropriate to milestone phases:
  - **90-day**: Content strategy, research, analysis, planning
  - **60-day**: Development, review, feedback, draft creation
  - **30-day**: Execution, finalization, publication, submission
- Timeline progress calculation with overdue milestone detection
- Content calendar integration with milestone-based suggestions

### Path Discovery Test Coverage
- Direct relationship path identification (1-degree)
- Multi-hop path discovery up to 7-degree limit
- Algorithm comparison: BFS (shortest path), DFS (depth exploration), Dijkstra (weighted optimization)
- Confidence scoring incorporating relationship strength and network topology
- Network analysis with centrality metrics and key connector identification
- Performance validation ensuring sub-1-second response times

## Mock Data Validation

All tests utilize comprehensive mock data structures that simulate:
- **Complex relationship networks** with 13+ entities and 18+ connections
- **Multi-tenant scenarios** with isolated data stores
- **Grant timeline scenarios** with various deadline configurations
- **Authentication flows** with proper JWT token simulation
- **Network topologies** supporting seven-degree separation testing
