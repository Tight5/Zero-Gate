## Implementation Components

### Enhanced Orchestration Agent (agents/orchestration.py)
```python
# Memory monitoring with critical thresholds
self.memory_thresholds = {
    "warning": 0.75,    # 75% - warning level
    "critical": 0.90,   # 90% - feature degradation required
    "emergency": 0.95   # 95% - emergency shutdown
}

# Automatic feature degradation
async def _trigger_feature_degradation(self, memory_usage: float):
    if memory_usage >= self.memory_thresholds["critical"]:
        features_to_disable = [
            'advanced_analytics',
            'relationship_mapping', 
            'excel_processing'
        ]
        for feature in features_to_disable:
            await self.resource_monitor.disable_feature(feature)
```

### Enhanced ResourceMonitor (utils/resource_monitor.py)
```python
# Memory management methods
def get_memory_usage(self) -> float:
    """Return memory usage as percentage (0.0-1.0)"""
    
def disable_feature(self, feature_name: str) -> bool:
    """Disable non-essential feature during high memory"""
    
def enable_feature(self, feature_name: str) -> bool:
    """Re-enable feature when memory normalizes"""
    
def trigger_garbage_collection(self) -> bool:
    """Force garbage collection for emergency cleanup"""
```

### Express API Integration (server/routes/orchestration.ts)
- `/api/orchestration/status` - Real-time memory and feature status
- `/api/orchestration/memory/optimize` - Manual memory optimization
- `/api/orchestration/features/recover` - Feature recovery controls
- `/api/orchestration/submit-task` - Memory-aware task submission
- `/api/orchestration/health` - Comprehensive health monitoring

### Frontend Dashboard (client/src/components/orchestration/OrchestrationMemoryDashboard.tsx)
- Real-time memory usage visualization with threshold indicators
- Feature degradation status tracking with visual badges
- Emergency optimization controls (standard and force)
- System information display with active workflows and queue size
