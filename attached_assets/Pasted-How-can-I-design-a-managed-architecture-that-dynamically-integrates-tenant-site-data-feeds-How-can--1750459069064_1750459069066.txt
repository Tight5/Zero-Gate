How can I design a managed architecture that dynamically integrates tenant site data feeds
Managed Architecture for Dynamic Tenant Site Data Feeds Integration
Core Architecture Design
1. Hierarchical Tenant Data Management Framework
Implementation:

python
class TenantDataManager:
    def __init__(self, tenant_id):
        self.tenant_id = tenant_id
        self.data_sources = self._load_data_sources()
        self.cache = RedisCache(tenant_id)
        self.db = PostgreSQLConnection(tenant_id)

    def _load_data_sources(self):
        # Fetch tenant-specific data sources from configuration
        return ConfigService.get_tenant_sources(self.tenant_id)

    def ingest_data(self):
        for source in self.data_sources:
            if source['type'] == 'microsoft_graph':
                data = MicrosoftGraphAPI(source).fetch_data()
                self.process_data(data)

    def process_data(self, data):
        # Apply tenant-specific transformations
        processed = TransformationEngine.apply(data, self.tenant_id)
        self.cache.set('latest_data', processed)
        self.db.write('tenant_data', processed)
2. Dynamic Feed Integration System
Components:

Feed Discovery Service: Automatically detects and registers new data sources

Schema Adapter: Converts incoming data to unified format

Tenant-Specific Processing Pipeline:

graph LR
A[Raw Data] --> B(Schema Mapping)
B --> C{Data Type}
C -->|Structured| D[Relational DB]
C -->|Semi-structured| E[Document DB]
C -->|Unstructured| F[Object Storage]
3. Orchestration Agent Architecture
Enhanced Agent Capabilities:

python
class OrchestrationAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.resource_monitor = ResourceMonitor()
        self.tenant_agents = {}
        
    def add_tenant(self, tenant_id):
        self.tenant_agents[tenant_id] = TenantAgent(tenant_id)
        
    def manage_resources(self):
        if self.resource_monitor.memory > 90:
            self.degrade_features(['advanced_analytics'])
        elif self.resource_monitor.memory > 85:
            self.degrade_features(['relationship_mapping'])
            
    def process_tenant_data(self):
        for tenant_id, agent in self.tenant_agents.items():
            if self.resource_monitor.can_process(tenant_id):
                agent.ingest_and_process()
Key Integration Patterns
1. Microsoft 365 Integration Pattern
text
sequenceDiagram
    participant Tenant
    participant ZeroGate
    participant MicrosoftGraph
    Tenant->>ZeroGate: Initiate OAuth2 flow
    ZeroGate->>MicrosoftGraph: Request auth code
    MicrosoftGraph->>Tenant: Permission consent
    Tenant->>ZeroGate: Return auth code
    ZeroGate->>MicrosoftGraph: Exchange for tokens
    MicrosoftGraph->>ZeroGate: Access/Refresh tokens
    ZeroGate->>MicrosoftGraph: Periodic data syncs
    MicrosoftGraph->>ZeroGate: Organizational data
    ZeroGate->>TenantDB: Store processed data
2. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation Strategy
Hybrid Approach:

Shared Database with Row-Level Security: For common tenant metadata

Tenant-Specific Schemas: For organizational structure data

Separate Databases: For high-security tenants (compliance requirements)

Implementation:

sql
-- Row-level security policy
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy
ON tenant_data
USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant'));
Performance Optimization
1. Hierarchical Memory Architecture
python
class MemoryManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.levels = {
            'L1': RedisCache(size=1GB),
            'L2': MemcachedCluster(size=10GB),
            'L3': PostgreSQL(pool_size=20)
        }
    
    def get_data(self, tenant_id, key):
        for level in ['L1', 'L2', 'L3']:
            data = self.levels[level].get(f"{tenant_id}:{key}")
            if data: 
                # Promote to higher cache level
                if level != 'L1': self.levels['L1'].set(key, data)
                return data
        return None
2. Data Processing Optimization
Strategies:

Selective Processing: Only process changed data via Graph API delta queries

Batched Processing: Group small updates into batches

Priority Queues:

python
queue = PriorityQueue()
queue.add_task(high_priority_tenant, priority=1)
queue.add_task(low_priority_tenant, priority=3)
Security Implementation
1. Tenant Data Isolation

        C -->|Yes| D[Admin Access]
        C -->|No| E[Tenant Context Loader]
        E --> F[Tenant-Specific Data Partition]
    end
2. Microsoft 365 Integration Security
python
class GraphAPISecurity:
    def __init__(self, tenant_id):
        self.tenant_id = tenant_id
        self.token = self.get_token()
        
    def get_token(self):
        # Implement token refresh with offline_access scope
        if token_expired(self.token):
            return refresh_token(self.tenant_id)
        return self.token
    
    def refresh_token(self):
        # Use refresh token with limited lifetime (1-2 hours)
        new_token = msal.acquire_token_by_refresh_token(...)
        audit_log(f"Token refreshed for {self.tenant_id}")
        return new_token
Tenant Onboarding Workflow
Automated Onboarding Sequence
Provisioning:

python
def create_tenant(tenant_info):
    db.create_tenant(tenant_info)
    create_schema(tenant_info['id'])
    setup_default_integrations(tenant_info)
Data Source Configuration:

json
{
  "microsoft_integration": {
    "enabled": true,
    "scopes": ["User.Read", "People.Read"],
    "refresh_interval": 3600
  },
  "custom_feeds": [
    {"name": "CRM", "type": "salesforce", "config": {...}}
  ]
}
Initial Data Sync:

python
def initial_sync(tenant_id):
    graph_data = MicrosoftGraphAPI(tenant_id).get_all_data()
    chunked_data = partition_data(graph_data, 1000)
    with ThreadPool(4) as pool:
        pool.map(process_chunk, chunked_data)
Monitoring and Maintenance
1. Tenant-Specific Monitoring Dashboard
Key Metrics:

Data freshness (last successful sync)

Processing latency

Error rates per data source

Resource consumption

2. Automated Remediation
python
def check_tenant_health(tenant_id):
    status = health_monitor.get_status(tenant_id)
    if status == 'degraded':
        restart_agent(tenant_id)
        notify_ops(f"Restarted agent for {tenant_id}")
    elif status == 'failed':
        fallback_to_backup(tenant_id)
Deployment Strategy
Phased Rollout Plan
Phase 1: Implement core ingestion pipeline for Microsoft 365 data

Phase 2: Add support for custom tenant data feeds

Phase 3: Implement hierarchical memory management

Phase 4: Roll out automated tenant onboarding

Compliance Integration
Data Handling Framework

This architecture provides a comprehensive solution for dynamically integrating tenant site data feeds while addressing:

Scalability through hierarchical resource management

Security with tenant isolation and Microsoft 365 integration safeguards

Compliance via data classification and access controls

Performance with optimized processing and caching

Maintainability through automated onboarding and monitoring

The system leverages Microsoft Graph API as the primary data source while maintaining extensibility for custom tenant data feeds. The implementation can be rolled out incrementally while maintaining platform stability during the transition.

Align your previous two responses to align with our current build. Also ensure detailed schema updates to classify data and optimize its use and proper anaylis and reflection on both the admin and tenant side. Ensure you have an effective understanding of proper data display and alignment principles that directly correlate for our platform use cases. All data endpoints and reflections need to be updated and validated. Provide clear detailed recommendations to incorporate best practices across the board in our platform. Expand sponsor onboarding to include a data pull from the 365 source. Initiate a smart onboarding process where the onboarding facilitates an agent discovery mechanism that will break out the pertain info and contacts to support that sponsor onboarding into the tenant ecosystem and proper alignment throughout the Ui UX. Sponsor organization should have their own dedicated child pages where we can fully capture relationship management, grant management and sponsor deliverables that are pulled or pushed to the content calendar. Think full holistic feedback loops to inform not only full alignment but also can actively display active scenario planning, as an example and context we onboarding sponsor x, agent orch tasks an agent deep dive of the tenant 365 data for the specific sponsor. The agent/s then identify likely sponsor principles and stakeholders along with top 3 to 5 emerging topics impacting the sponsor relationship. For example the onboarding, after identifying likely principles scrubs and they are incorporated on the dominant side then push to the tenant side. The agent/s then do a topical search with regard to associated sponsors principals through email association. This then displays on the sponsor child pages. For example and context, sponsor x is onboarded and through a scrub on the last 60 days, the agents create a sponsor site picture crossed leveled with all other components on the platform capabilities. Incorporate proper application of all updates to match our build

Zero Gate ESO Platform: Enhanced Microsoft 365 Integration Architecture
Executive Summary
This document outlines a comprehensive architecture for enhancing the Zero Gate ESO Platform with advanced Microsoft 365 integration capabilities, focusing on sponsor onboarding and relationship management . The architecture addresses our current critical memory usage issues (93%) while implementing an efficient multi-agent system that extracts organizational context from Microsoft Graph API and feeds it into all aspects of the tenant ecosystem . By leveraging Microsoft 365 data, we can create a holistic view of sponsor relationships, automate content calendar integration, and provide actionable insights for both tenant and admin users .

Current System Status and Challenges
The Zero Gate ESO Platform is currently experiencing critical memory usage at 93%, exceeding our documented threshold of 85% . The orchestration agent is not properly disabling features at high memory thresholds, and several documented components are missing from the actual implementation . Our platform needs to support seamless switching between tenant mode (clint.phillips@thecenter.nasdaq.org) and admin mode (admin@tight5digital.com) while maintaining proper tenant isolation .

Enhanced Data Schema Design
Multi-Tenant Database Architecture
We'll implement a hybrid multi-tenant database architecture that combines shared tables with tenant-specific schemas for sensitive data :

sql
-- Shared tables with tenant_id
CREATE TABLE sponsors (
    sponsor_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    contact_info JSONB,
    relationship_manager VARCHAR(255),
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id) REFERENCES tenants(tenant_id)
);

-- Tenant-specific schema for organizational data
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_{tenant_id};

CREATE TABLE tenant_{tenant_id}.sponsor_organization (
    sponsor_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    org_structure JSONB,
    key_stakeholders JSONB,
    emerging_topics JSONB,
    communication_patterns JSONB,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (sponsor_id) REFERENCES sponsors(sponsor_id)
);
This approach provides strong tenant isolation while maintaining efficient resource usage, critical for our memory-constrained environment .

Data Classification Schema
To optimize data usage and analysis, we'll implement a classification schema for all sponsor-related data :

sql
CREATE TABLE data_classification (
    classification_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    data_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    sensitivity_level VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    retention_period INTEGER NOT NULL,
    access_control JSONB,
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id) REFERENCES tenants(tenant_id)
);

ALTER TABLE sponsors ADD COLUMN classification_id INTEGER REFERENCES data_classification(classification_id);
This schema enables proper data governance, access control, and retention policies for different types of sponsor data .

Microsoft 365 Integration Architecture
Enhanced Orchestration Agent
The Orchestration Agent serves as the central coordinator for the entire multi-agent system, managing workflow, resource allocation, and feature degradation :

python
class OrchestrationAgent:
    def __init__(self, resource_monitor):
        self.resource_monitor = resource_monitor
        self.agents = {
            'extraction': DataExtractionAgent(),
            'analysis': AnalysisAgent(),
            'integration': IntegrationAgent()
        }
        self.task_queue = asyncio.Queue()
        self.memory_manager = HierarchicalMemoryManager()
        
    async def orchestrate_sponsor_analysis(self, tenant_id, sponsor_id):
        # Check resource availability
        if self.resource_monitor.get_memory_usage() > 85:
            # Implement feature degradation
            return self._run_minimal_analysis(tenant_id, sponsor_id)
        
        # Normal workflow
        org_data = await self.agents['extraction'].extract_sponsor_data(tenant_id, sponsor_id)
        insights = await self.agents['analysis'].analyze_sponsor_data(org_data)
        await self.agents['integration'].integrate_sponsor_insights(tenant_id, sponsor_id, insights)
        
        # Update memory
        self.memory_manager.store_sponsor_insights(tenant_id, sponsor_id, insights)
This implementation ensures proper feature degradation when memory usage exceeds 85%, maintaining system stability while preserving essential functionality .

Microsoft Graph API Integration
We'll enhance our existing IntegrationAgent to extract comprehensive organizational data from the tenant's Microsoft 365 environment :

python
async def extract_sponsor_stakeholders(self, tenant_id, sponsor_domain):
    """Extract stakeholders related to a specific sponsor domain from Microsoft Graph"""
    graph_client = self.get_graph_client(tenant_id)
    
    # Get users who have communicated with the sponsor domain
    communications = await graph_client.me.mailbox_settings.get()
    
    # Search for emails with the sponsor domain
    email_filter = f"contains(toRecipients/emailAddress/address,'{sponsor_domain}')"
    emails = await graph_client.me.messages.get(filter=email_filter)
    
    # Extract stakeholders from email communications
    stakeholders = self._extract_stakeholders_from_emails(emails)
    
    # Get organizational context for each stakeholder
    for stakeholder in stakeholders:
        if stakeholder.get('email', '').endswith(sponsor_domain):
            org_context = await self._get_stakeholder_org_context(stakeholder['email'])
            stakeholder['org_context'] = org_context
    
    return stakeholders
This function extracts stakeholders related to a specific sponsor by analyzing email communications and retrieving organizational context for each stakeholder .

Smart Sponsor Onboarding Process
Agent-Driven Discovery Mechanism
We'll implement a smart onboarding process that leverages Microsoft 365 data to automatically discover and analyze sponsor information :

python
async def sponsor_onboarding_discovery(self, tenant_id, sponsor_name, sponsor_domain):
    """Discover sponsor information during onboarding process"""
    # Extract stakeholders from Microsoft 365
    stakeholders = await self.extract_sponsor_stakeholders(tenant_id, sponsor_domain)
    
    # Identify key principles based on communication patterns
    principles = self._identify_key_principles(stakeholders)
    
    # Extract emerging topics from email communications
    topics = await self.extract_emerging_topics(tenant_id, sponsor_domain)
    
    # Generate sponsor profile
    sponsor_profile = {
        'name': sponsor_name,
        'domain': sponsor_domain,
        'key_stakeholders': principles,
        'emerging_topics': topics,
        'last_updated': datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    
    return sponsor_profile
This process automatically discovers key stakeholders and emerging topics related to a sponsor during the onboarding process, providing valuable insights for relationship management .

Topic Extraction from Email Communications
We'll implement NLP-based topic extraction to identify emerging topics from email communications :

python
async def extract_emerging_topics(self, tenant_id, sponsor_domain, days=60):
    """Extract emerging topics from email communications with sponsor"""
    graph_client = self.get_graph_client(tenant_id)
    
    # Calculate date range
    end_date = datetime.now()
    start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=days)
    
    # Get emails related to sponsor
    email_filter = f"receivedDateTime ge {start_date.isoformat()} and receivedDateTime le {end_date.isoformat()} and contains(toRecipients/emailAddress/address,'{sponsor_domain}')"
    emails = await graph_client.me.messages.get(filter=email_filter)
    
    # Extract text content from emails
    text_content = [email.body.content for email in emails.value]
    
    # Use NLP to extract topics
    topics = self.nlp_processor.extract_topics(text_content)
    
    return topics[:5]  # Return top 5 topics
This function uses NLP techniques to extract emerging topics from email communications with a sponsor over the past 60 days, providing valuable insights for relationship management .

Sponsor Child Pages Architecture
Comprehensive Sponsor Profile
Each sponsor will have dedicated child pages that provide a comprehensive view of the relationship :

Sponsor Overview: General information, key metrics, and relationship status

Stakeholder Management: Key stakeholders, organizational structure, and communication patterns

Grant Management: Active grants, timelines, and deliverables

Content Calendar: Scheduled content related to the sponsor

Emerging Topics: Top topics affecting the sponsor relationship

React Component Structure
jsx
// src/components/sponsors/SponsorProfile.jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useTenant } from '../../contexts/TenantContext';
import { Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent } from '@replit/ui';
import SponsorOverview from './SponsorOverview';
import StakeholderManagement from './StakeholderManagement';
import GrantManagement from './GrantManagement';
import ContentCalendar from './ContentCalendar';
import EmergingTopics from './EmergingTopics';

const SponsorProfile = ({ sponsorId }) => {
  const { currentTenant } = useTenant();
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('overview');
  
  return (
    <div className="sponsor-profile">
      <Tabs value={activeTab} onValueChange={setActiveTab}>
        <TabsList>
          <TabsTrigger value="overview">Overview</TabsTrigger>
          <TabsTrigger value="stakeholders">Stakeholders</TabsTrigger>
          <TabsTrigger value="grants">Grants</TabsTrigger>
          <TabsTrigger value="calendar">Content Calendar</TabsTrigger>
          <TabsTrigger value="topics">Emerging Topics</TabsTrigger>
        </TabsList>
        
        <TabsContent value="overview">
          <SponsorOverview sponsorId={sponsorId} />
        </TabsContent>
        
        <TabsContent value="stakeholders">
          <StakeholderManagement sponsorId={sponsorId} />
        </TabsContent>
        
        <TabsContent value="grants">
          <GrantManagement sponsorId={sponsorId} />
        </TabsContent>
        
        <TabsContent value="calendar">
          <ContentCalendar sponsorId={sponsorId} />
        </TabsContent>
        
        <TabsContent value="topics">
          <EmergingTopics sponsorId={sponsorId} />
        </TabsContent>
      </Tabs>
    </div>
  );
};

export default SponsorProfile;
This component structure provides a comprehensive view of the sponsor relationship, with dedicated tabs for different aspects of the relationship .

Holistic Feedback Loops
Data Flow Architecture
We'll implement a holistic feedback loop that continuously updates the sponsor profile based on new data from Microsoft 365 :

text
graph TD
    A[Microsoft 365 Data] --> B[Data Extraction Agent]
    B --> C[Analysis Agent]
    C --> D[Sponsor Profile]
    D --> E[Relationship Management]
    E --> F[Grant Management]
    F --> G[Content Calendar]
    G --> H[Feedback Loop]
    H --> B
This architecture ensures that all components of the platform are continuously updated with the latest information from Microsoft 365, providing a comprehensive view of the sponsor relationship .

Scenario Planning Implementation
We'll implement scenario planning capabilities that leverage the extracted data to provide actionable insights :

python
async def generate_sponsor_scenarios(self, tenant_id, sponsor_id):
    """Generate scenarios for sponsor relationship based on emerging topics"""
    # Get sponsor profile
    sponsor = await self.get_sponsor_profile(tenant_id, sponsor_id)
    
    # Get emerging topics
    topics = sponsor.get('emerging_topics', [])
    
    # Generate scenarios for each topic
    scenarios = []
    for topic in topics:
        scenario = {
            'topic': topic['name'],
            'impact': self._assess_topic_impact(topic),
            'recommendations': self._generate_recommendations(topic),
            'content_suggestions': self._suggest_content(topic)
        }
        scenarios.append(scenario)
    
    return scenarios
This function generates scenarios for each emerging topic, including impact assessment, recommendations, and content suggestions .

Memory Optimization Strategies
To address the critical memory usage issues (93%), we'll implement the following optimization strategies :

Connection Pooling Optimization
python
class DatabaseConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self, max_connections=10, idle_timeout=300):
        self.pool = {}
        self.max_connections = max_connections
        self.idle_timeout = idle_timeout
        self.last_used = {}
        
    async def get_connection(self, tenant_id):
        # Check if connection exists and is not idle
        if tenant_id in self.pool and (time.time() - self.last_used.get(tenant_id, 0)) < self.idle_timeout:
            self.last_used[tenant_id] = time.time()
            return self.pool[tenant_id]
            
        # Create new connection if under limit
        if len(self.pool) < self.max_connections:
            self.pool[tenant_id] = await self._create_connection(tenant_id)
            self.last_used[tenant_id] = time.time()
            return self.pool[tenant_id]
            
        # Recycle least recently used connection
        lru_tenant = min(self.last_used, key=self.last_used.get)
        await self._close_connection(lru_tenant)
        del self.pool[lru_tenant]
        del self.last_used[lru_tenant]
        
        # Create new connection
        self.pool[tenant_id] = await self._create_connection(tenant_id)
        self.last_used[tenant_id] = time.time()
        return self.pool[tenant_id]
This optimized connection pooling implementation prevents connection accumulation and recycles idle connections, significantly reducing memory usage .

React Component Optimization
jsx
// Memoized component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
const SponsorStakeholders = React.memo(({ sponsorId }) => {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useSponsorStakeholders(sponsorId);
  
  // Component implementation
});

// Optimized hook with proper cleanup
const useSponsorStakeholders = (sponsorId) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    let isMounted = true;
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const result = await apiService.get(`/sponsors/${sponsorId}/stakeholders`);
        if (isMounted) {
          setData(result);
          setIsLoading(false);
        }
      } catch (err) {
        if (isMounted) {
          setError(err);
          setIsLoading(false);
        }
      }
    };
    
    fetchData();
    
    // Cleanup function to prevent memory leaks
    return () => {
      isMounted = false;
    };
  }, [sponsorId]);
  
  return { data, isLoading, error };
};
These optimizations prevent unnecessary re-renders and memory leaks in React components, reducing frontend memory consumption .

Tenant/Admin Mode Switching
The architecture supports seamless switching between tenant mode (clint.phillips@thecenter.nasdaq.org) and admin mode (admin@tight5digital.com) :

Frontend Implementation
jsx
// src/contexts/TenantContext.jsx
export const TenantProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const [currentTenant, setCurrentTenant] = useState(null);
  const [isAdminMode, setIsAdminMode] = useState(false);
  
  // Check if user is admin
  const isAdmin = user?.email === 'admin@tight5digital.com';
  
  // Toggle between admin and tenant mode
  const toggleAdminMode = () => {
    if (isAdmin) {
      setIsAdminMode(!isAdminMode);
      // Update API service headers
      apiService.setAdminMode(!isAdminMode);
    }
  };
  
  // Context value
  const value = {
    currentTenant,
    isAdminMode,
    isAdmin,
    toggleAdminMode,
    // Other methods
  };
  
  return (
    <TenantContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </TenantContext.Provider>
  );
};
This implementation allows admin users to seamlessly switch between tenant and admin modes while maintaining proper context .

Content Calendar Integration
We'll enhance the content calendar integration to automatically generate content suggestions based on emerging topics :

jsx
// src/components/calendar/ContentSuggestions.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Card, Button } from '@replit/ui';
import { useSponsorTopics } from '../../hooks/useSponsorData';

const ContentSuggestions = ({ sponsorId }) => {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useSponsorTopics(sponsorId);
  
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading suggestions...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error loading suggestions</div>;
  
  return (
    <div className="content-suggestions">
      <h3>Content Suggestions</h3>
      <div className="suggestions-grid">
        {data?.topics.map((topic) => (
          <Card key={topic.id} className="suggestion-card">
            <h4>{topic.name}</h4>
            <p>{topic.description}</p>
            <div className="suggestion-actions">
              <Button variant="outline" size="sm">
                Add to Calendar
              </Button>
            </div>
          </Card>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ContentSuggestions;
This component displays content suggestions based on emerging topics extracted from Microsoft 365 data, helping users create relevant content for sponsors .

To support the enhanced functionality, we need to update the following API endpoints :

python
@router.get("/sponsors/{sponsor_id}/stakeholders")
async def get_sponsor_stakeholders(
    sponsor_id: str,
    request: Request,
    tenant: TenantContext = Depends(require_tenant)
):
    """Get stakeholders for a specific sponsor"""
    try:
        integration_agent = request.app.state.integration_agent
        stakeholders = await integration_agent.extract_sponsor_stakeholders(
            tenant.tenant_id, sponsor_id
        )
        return stakeholders
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error extracting sponsor stakeholders: {str(e)}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Failed to extract sponsor stakeholders")

@router.get("/sponsors/{sponsor_id}/topics")
async def get_sponsor_topics(
    sponsor_id: str,
    request: Request,
    tenant: TenantContext = Depends(require_tenant)
):
    """Get emerging topics for a specific sponsor"""
    try:
        integration_agent = request.app.state.integration_agent
        topics = await integration_agent.extract_emerging_topics(
            tenant.tenant_id, sponsor_id
        )
        return topics
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error extracting sponsor topics: {str(e)}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Failed to extract sponsor topics")
These endpoints provide access to stakeholder information and emerging topics for sponsors, enabling the enhanced functionality of the platform .

Conclusion
The proposed architecture provides a comprehensive solution for enhancing the Zero Gate ESO Platform with advanced Microsoft 365 integration capabilities . By implementing a smart onboarding process, dedicated sponsor child pages, and holistic feedback loops, we can provide a comprehensive view of sponsor relationships and actionable insights for both tenant and admin users . The architecture addresses the current memory usage issues while providing a scalable foundation for future growth .

To lessen internal data base needs, can we extend database storage to tenant 365 on drive? Create a direct link to a hidden folder in the orgs onedrive, that can act as a cloud database architecture? Is this feasible, if so, make the alignment as if all previous architecture has been implemented. Align with our project framework and apply all needed updates to pipeline, data and agent interactions within the ecosystem. This should be an auto complete feature and n sponsor or data onboarding.

OneDrive Integration for Zero Gate ESO Platform: Cloud Database Architecture
Executive Summary
This report evaluates the feasibility of extending the Zero Gate ESO Platform's database architecture to leverage Microsoft 365 OneDrive as a cloud storage solution for tenant data. By creating direct links to hidden folders within organizational OneDrive accounts, we can potentially reduce internal database requirements while maintaining the platform's functionality. Our analysis indicates this approach is feasible with specific limitations and optimizations, and can be implemented as an auto-complete feature during sponsor onboarding.

Current Architecture Assessment
The Zero Gate ESO Platform currently experiences critical memory usage (93%) despite previous optimization efforts. The platform supports multi-tenant isolation through PostgreSQL with row-level security, but faces scalability challenges as tenant data grows. Microsoft Graph API integration is already implemented for authentication and organizational data extraction.

Key Limitations of Current Architecture
High memory consumption (93% - exceeding 85% threshold)

Database connection pooling inefficiencies

Scaling challenges with increasing tenant data

Resource-intensive relationship mapping features

OneDrive as Cloud Database Architecture
Feasibility Analysis
Using OneDrive as an extension of our database architecture is technically feasible with important considerations:

API Support: Microsoft Graph API provides comprehensive access to OneDrive storage with methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.

Storage Capacity: OneDrive for Business offers substantial storage (1TB+ per user) that can accommodate tenant data requirements.

Security: OneDrive provides robust security features including encryption, access controls, and Personal Vault for sensitive data.

Performance Considerations: OneDrive has specific limitations that impact its use as a database alternative.

Technical Limitations
Several technical constraints must be addressed in the implementation:

File Size Limits:

Single PUT requests limited to 4MB per file

Upload sessions required for files 4MB-60MB

Maximum file size of 250GB per file

API Rate Limits:

130,000 requests per 10 seconds per app across all tenants

Throttling applied when exceeding limits

Concurrency Challenges:

File locking mechanisms may impact concurrent access

Potential conflicts with simultaneous read/write operations

Performance Considerations:

Average transfer rate around 25MB/s for large files

Degraded performance with high file counts (>5000 items)

Proposed Implementation Architecture
Hybrid Storage Model
We propose implementing a hybrid storage architecture that leverages both PostgreSQL and OneDrive:

Core Tenant Data: Maintain essential tenant metadata, authentication, and relationship mapping data in PostgreSQL for performance and concurrency.

Extended Storage: Utilize OneDrive for document storage, sponsor profiles, historical data, and content assets.

Tenant OneDrive Integration
Each tenant organization will have a dedicated hidden folder structure in their OneDrive, created during onboarding:

text
/ZeroGateESO/
  /TenantData/
    /Sponsors/
      /{sponsor_id}/
        sponsor_profile.json
        stakeholders.json
        emerging_topics.json
        communication_patterns.json
    /Grants/
      /{grant_id}/
        grant_details.json
        milestones.json
        deliverables/
    /Analytics/
      relationship_graph.json
      historical_metrics/
Data Synchronization Architecture
To address concurrency and performance challenges, we'll implement a robust synchronization mechanism:

Local Cache: Maintain a local cache of frequently accessed data to reduce API calls.

Change Tracking: Implement delta queries and webhooks to monitor file changes efficiently.

Conflict Resolution: Develop versioning and conflict resolution strategies for concurrent modifications.

Batch Processing: Optimize API usage through batched operations and request consolidation.

Integration with Existing Components
Enhanced Orchestration Agent
The Orchestration Agent will be extended to manage OneDrive storage operations:

python
class OrchestrationAgent:
    def __init__(self, resource_monitor):
        self.resource_monitor = resource_monitor
        self.agents = {
            'extraction': DataExtractionAgent(),
            'analysis': AnalysisAgent(),
            'integration': IntegrationAgent(),
            'storage': OneDriveStorageAgent()  # New agent for OneDrive operations
        }
        # Existing initialization code
OneDrive Storage Agent
A new OneDriveStorageAgent will handle all interactions with tenant OneDrive storage:

python
class OneDriveStorageAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph_clients = {}
        self.file_cache = {}
        
    async def ensure_folder_structure(self, tenant_id):
        """Create the necessary folder structure in tenant OneDrive"""
        # Implementation code
        
    async def store_json_data(self, tenant_id, path, data):
        """Store JSON data in tenant OneDrive with optimized chunking"""
        # Implementation code for files under 4MB
        if data_size <= 4 * 1024 * 1024:
            return await self._store_small_file(tenant_id, path, data)
        else:
            return await self._store_large_file(tenant_id, path, data)
Microsoft Graph API Integration
We'll enhance our existing Microsoft Graph integration to support OneDrive operations:

python
async def create_upload_session(self, tenant_id, file_path):
    """Create an upload session for large files"""
    graph_client = self.get_graph_client(tenant_id)
    
    response = await graph_client.me.drive.root.item_path(file_path).create_upload_session.post()
    
    return response.upload_url
Auto-Complete Sponsor Onboarding Process
The sponsor onboarding process will be enhanced to automatically create and populate the OneDrive storage structure:

Tenant Authorization: Secure delegated permissions to access tenant OneDrive during initial setup.

Folder Creation: Automatically create the required folder structure in the tenant's OneDrive.

Data Migration: For existing tenants, migrate relevant data to OneDrive storage.

Microsoft 365 Integration: Extract sponsor information from Microsoft Graph and store in OneDrive.

Performance Optimization Strategies
To ensure optimal performance with OneDrive integration, we'll implement several optimization strategies:

Intelligent Caching: Cache frequently accessed data locally to reduce API calls.

Delta Queries: Use delta queries to efficiently track changes in OneDrive files.

Webhooks: Implement webhooks to receive real-time notifications of file changes.

Chunked Uploads: Optimize file uploads using appropriate chunking strategies based on file size.

Batch Operations: Consolidate multiple API operations into batched requests where possible.

Security Considerations
The OneDrive integration introduces specific security considerations that must be addressed:

Delegated Permissions: Use appropriate Microsoft Graph scopes (Files.ReadWrite) with least privilege principles.

Data Encryption: Ensure sensitive data is encrypted before storage in OneDrive.

Access Controls: Implement proper access controls for the Zero Gate ESO folder structure.

Audit Logging: Maintain comprehensive logs of all OneDrive operations for compliance and troubleshooting.

Sponsor profiles	PostgreSQL	Frequent queries
Document attachments	OneDrive	Large file optimization
Historical analytics	OneDrive	Infrequent access
Relationship graphs	PostgreSQL + OneDrive	Hybrid storage
Auto-Complete Onboarding Workflow
Hidden Folder Creation:

python
async def create_hidden_folder(tenant_id):
    graph_client = get_graph_client(tenant_id)
    response = await graph_client.drive.root.children.post({
        "name": "ZeroGateESO",
        "folder": {},
        "@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior": "rename"
    })
    # Set hidden attribute via Microsoft Graph API
    await set_hidden_attribute(response.id)
Automated Data Placement:

python
async def store_data(tenant_id, data_type, content):
    if data_type in ['sponsor_docs', 'historical']:
        # Use OneDrive for large files
        await onedrive_agent.store_json(tenant_id, f"{data_type}/{uuid}.json", content)
    else:
        # Store in PostgreSQL
        db.store(tenant_id, data_type, content)
Critical Implementation Requirements
1. Chunked Upload Handling
python
class OneDriveStorageAgent:
    async def store_large_file(self, tenant_id, path, content):
        upload_session = await self.create_upload_session(tenant_id, path)
        chunk_size = 4 * 1024 * 1024  # 4MB chunks
        for i in range(0, len(content), chunk_size):
            chunk = content[i:i+chunk_size]
            await self.upload_chunk(upload_session, chunk, i)
2. Throttling Management System
python
def handle_throttling(response):
    if response.status == 429:
        retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', 5))
        logger.warning(f"Throttling detected. Retrying in {retry_after} seconds")
        time.sleep(retry_after)
        return True
    return False

Conclusion
Using hidden OneDrive folders as a cloud database extension is feasible for specific use cases with these conditions:

Suitable for infrequently accessed large files

Requires robust chunking for >4MB data

Demands strict API rate limit management

Best for archival and document storage

For metadata and frequently accessed data, maintain PostgreSQL storage. Implement the hybrid model with auto-complete onboarding to balance performance with storage optimization. Critical performance path data should remain in PostgreSQL while leveraging OneDrive for large, infrequently accessed files.

How does creating such links affect data synchronization and access control
How does creating such links affect data synchronization and access control
Based on the search results, creating direct links to OneDrive folders (especially via "Add Shortcut" or hidden folders) significantly impacts data synchronization and access control:

Synchronization Impacts
Broken Local Sync Functionality:

Shared folders converted to web shortcuts (.url files) lose local sync capabilities ()

Users can't access files directly in File Explorer - must download/upload via browser

Automatic background syncing is disabled for shortcut-based "folders"

Data Loss Risks:

Recent updates automatically converted existing synced folders to web shortcuts, deleting local copies (800GB in one case) ()

"Add Shortcut" creates a 3-point connection (SharePoint ↔ Local ↔ OneDrive) that increases failure points ()

Manual Sync Requirements:

Shared folders require explicit "Add to my OneDrive" + manual sync selection per device ()

No automatic sync even after adding to OneDrive - must configure sync separately

Access Control Impacts
Hidden Folders:

Toggling "Hidden" changes all user roles to "Access Denied" by default ()

Requires manual re-enablement per user after hiding

Transparent UI indication doesn't prevent accidental access denial

Permission Conflicts:

"Add Shortcut" creates permission inheritance issues impacting sync performance ()

Users with "Can Edit" permissions can accidentally modify source SharePoint files ()

Enterprise Control Limitations:

Group Policies can block folder redirection and external sync ()

Registry keys (KFMBlockOptOut/BlockExternalSync) allow admins to enforce:

Mandatory Known Folder Move to OneDrive

Blocking cross-org B2B sync

Critical Design Implications
Avoid "Add Shortcut" for Core Data:

Not suitable for database-like access due to web shortcut conversion ()

Use only for individual file sharing, not folder structures

Hidden Folders Require Re-Permissioning:

Hiding breaks all existing permissions ()

Not suitable for shared data - better for archival

Sync Workflow Recommendations:

text
graph LR
A[Shared Content] --> B{User Role}
B -->|Editor| C[Sync via SharePoint]
B -->|Viewer| D[Web Access Only]
C --> E[Direct Local Access]
Enforce "Sync" button for business files instead of shortcuts ()

Maintain separation between personal OneDrive and business SharePoint

Best Practices
Access Control:

Use SharePoint permissions directly, not through OneDrive shortcuts

Implement Group Policies to block problematic features:

text
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\OneDrive]
"BlockExternalSync"=dword:00000001
"KFMBlockOptOut"=dword:00000001
Synchronization:

Sync SharePoint libraries directly, not via OneDrive shortcuts

Use "Sync" button in SharePoint interface ()

For shared folders:

Open SharePoint library

Select "Sync"

Verify in OneDrive settings

Hidden Data Management:

Use for archival only - not active collaboration

Document explicit permission reassignment process after hiding:

text
flowchart LR
A[Hide Folder] --> B[Notify Admins]
B --> C[Re-enable per-user]
C --> D[Communicate Changes]
These impacts necessitate avoiding OneDrive shortcuts/hidden folders for database-like access. Instead, use direct SharePoint sync with granular permissions for business data, reserving OneDrive for personal file management. For the Zero Gate ESO Platform, maintain PostgreSQL for operational data and use SharePoint/OneDrive only for document storage with strict access controls.
