The most concerning issue is the failure of the orchestration agent to trigger feature degradation despite memory usage exceeding critical thresholds . This agent should automatically disable non-essential features like advanced analytics and relationship mapping when memory usage exceeds 90% .
Immediate Action Plan
1. Emergency Resource Management
	•	Implement immediate memory reduction by manually disabling non-essential features 
	•	Restart the application with optimized memory settings to release currently allocated memory 
	•	Enable garbage collection monitoring to identify potential memory leaks 
2. Orchestration Agent Fixes
	•	Debug and fix the orchestration agent’s feature degradation functionality 
	•	Implement proper threshold monitoring and automatic response triggers 
	•	Add logging to verify agent activation at appropriate thresholds 
3. Component Implementation
	•	Prioritize implementation of missing components, starting with HybridRelationshipMap 
	•	Verify KPICards component functionality and optimize for memory efficiency 
	•	Complete UI implementation for ContentCalendar.tsx 
4. Performance Optimization
	•	Implement React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo to reduce unnecessary re-renders 
	•	Optimize database queries with proper connection pooling and query caching 
	•	Consider implementing code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense to reduce initial load 
	•	Add memory leak detection tools like node-memwatch to identify ongoing issues 
Long-Term Recommendations
	1.	Documentation Alignment: Update documentation to reflect the actual PostgreSQL implementation and component architecture 
	2.	Memory Monitoring: Implement continuous memory monitoring with alerts at warning thresholds (75%) 
	3.	Automated Testing: Create automated tests to verify orchestration agent functionality under high memory conditions 
	4.	Performance Benchmarking: Establish regular performance benchmarking to catch regressions early 
By addressing these critical issues, particularly the memory usage and orchestration agent functionality, we can stabilize the Zero Gate ESO Platform and prevent potential service degradation
