# Zero Gate ESO Platform

## Overview

The Zero Gate ESO Platform is a sophisticated multi-tenant Executive Service Organization management system built with React/TypeScript frontend and Express.js backend. The application provides comprehensive tools for managing sponsor relationships, grant opportunities with backwards planning timelines, hybrid relationship mapping with 7-degree path discovery, content calendar integration, and strategic networking within the ESO ecosystem. It uses Replit Auth for authentication and PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with tenant-based routing

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with migrations
- **Multi-tenancy**: Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for complete tenant isolation
- **Security**: PostgreSQL RLS policies enforce tenant boundaries at database level
- **Schema**: Includes users, tenants, sponsors, grants, relationships, and content calendar tables with comprehensive RLS protection

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Implements Replit Auth using OpenID Connect
- Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL session store
- Multi-tenant user support with role-based access
- Automatic token refresh and session management

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Tenant context middleware for data isolation
- User-tenant relationship management
- Tenant-specific API endpoints with header-based routing
- Role-based permissions within tenants

### AI Agent Architecture
- **ProcessingAgent**: NetworkX-based relationship graph processing with seven-degree path discovery
- **OrchestrationAgent**: Asyncio workflow management with resource-aware feature toggling
- **IntegrationAgent**: Microsoft Graph API integration for organizational data extraction
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent system monitoring with automatic feature degradation

### Data Management
- Sponsors: Complete contact and relationship management with tier classification and network centrality scoring
- Grants: Timeline tracking with backwards planning (90/60/30-day milestones) and automated risk assessment
- Relationships: NetworkX-powered graph visualization with landmark-based distance estimation
- Content Calendar: Strategic communication planning with grant milestone integration
- Advanced Analytics: Real-time system resource monitoring and performance tracking with scaling indicators

### User Interface
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Dark/light theme support through CSS custom properties
- Component-based architecture using shadcn/ui
- Interactive dashboards with real-time data updates

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User initiates login through Replit Auth
2. OpenID Connect handles authentication and token exchange
3. User session created and stored in PostgreSQL
4. Frontend receives authenticated user context
5. API requests include session credentials for authorization

### API Request Flow
1. Frontend makes authenticated request with tenant headers
2. Express middleware validates session and extracts tenant context
3. Drizzle ORM queries filtered by tenant ID
4. Response data returned with proper error handling
5. React Query manages caching and state updates

### Real-time Updates
- React Query provides optimistic updates and background refetching
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Error boundary handling for graceful degradation
